My interests are broadly in theory and applications of dynamical systems. This constitutes developing new methods - analytical and numerical - for solving problems in engineering and natural sciences.


### Geometric theory of escape and transition

### Lobe d​ynamics and transport in heteroclinic tangles

### Partial control of escaping dynamics and chaos


### ​​Coherent Structures in 3 dimensional flows.
