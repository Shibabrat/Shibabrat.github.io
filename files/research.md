## Research highlights

<!-- # Research topics and related articles with collaborators -->

My interests are broadly in theory and applications of dynamical systems. This constitutes developing new methods - analytical and numerical - for solving problems in engineering and natural sciences.


### Geometric theory of escape and transition

### Lobe d​ynamics and transport in heteroclinic tangles

### Partial control of escaping dynamics and chaos


### ​​Coherent Structures in 3 dimensional flows.


## Research interests

Dynamical systems theory: Geometric and statistical methods of chaotic dynamics, Discovery of structures in phase space transport, Partial control of escape and transition dynamics, Phase space structures based control.

Data-driven methods: Transport barriers in atmosphere and ocean, Machine learning phase space structures, Reduced order modeling, Defect and anomaly detection in structural dynamics
